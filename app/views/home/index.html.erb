      <h2>About FairPay</h2>
      <p>Companies benefit from keeping employees in the dark about compensation. This leads to serious societal issues, like the huge disparity between men and women when it comes to compensation. Our service aims to shed light on this world, changing the conversation about salaries and compensation by encouraging transparency. We also hope to provide accurate data, and realize that markets are complex and just a title isn't enough to get accurate data. This is why we require you to sign in with your LinkedIn account.</p>
