# Rails FairPay app

## Installing

This is a Rails 4 / Ruby 2 app. I recommend rbenv to manage your ruby installations. Once you are set up for RoR, to get started as a developer, do the usual Rails invocations:

`$ bundle install`

To run the local server (default port 3000) execute:

`$ bundle exec rails s`

## Testing

TODO fill me in
